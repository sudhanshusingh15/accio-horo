A basic Horoscope web-app using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and Node

INTRODUCTION

Horoscope web app which let users log in and view their personal daily Horoscope.

ARCHITECTURE

Technology Used – We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Firebase. We tried to implement React in our project, but we were not successful. 
We had issues with front-end when we tried beautifying it using grid/flexbox Layout in Bootstrap. This caused our whole layout to crash and irreversible after certain edits. So, we had to start from scratch again, which took most of our time.

Overview – The horoscope web app that we created is fairly simple. Technically, we use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap to create the frontend and Javascript to communicate with the server. For Sign-up/Sign-in, we store the details (including astro signs) in Firebase and save/retrieve it for purposes. We send the horoscope signs to a basic free API, which in return sends the daily/weekly horoscope details. We present the final details in the user’s personalized horoscope page.



REFLECTION

Original Features – We initially planned on implementing everything we already did along with React, but we were not able to which is why instead of that we used Bootstrap. Our original feature included many front-end JS libraries to make the UX/UI neater and cleaner. But due to some time and team-mate schedule restrictions, we were not able to collaborate everything online. 
We also planned to implement email-verification for Sign-up, but we encountered various errors and ended up removing the feature.

Actual Features – Our website comprises of almost everything we planned on doing like a sign-up form to register users with us. Then the users are able to log in and see their horoscopic details. We did this using HTML, JavaScript, Firebase, and Bootstrap. We used basic CSS to design our website and give it a professional look.

Goals – I think we only fell short of one thing and that was using React in our project. I think we struggled a bit because we did not start on time and we had a very tight time constraint. From next time, we would definitely try to start beforehand so that there is enough time to improvise and implement new features in our project. 
We also struggled a lot with team-mate coordination due to members living in different countries and two of our members dropping this course. Collaboration was extremely difficult through Zoom, since most of us left in the middle and others were fairly new to Web development. 
What we learned from mistakes – We realized that we have to have various back-up plans for instances like team-mates leaving, coming across a major error and learn to coordinate with other team members who have different schedules.
